</p>
<b>Level 1</b>
<p>At the level one, your car just moves from the bottom to the top. The player can speed up or down using the keys 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Initially, the car’s speed is zero (= no background moving). But using the keys, the speed can be increased or decreased. Note that you can change the speed gradually such as 0->1->2->3->2->1->2->->3->4 ... You can’t simply jump from the speed one to speed four directly.</p>
<p>When your car reaches at the end of map, your game pauses a few seconds and moves to the level two.
</p>
<b>Level 2</b>
<p>Atlevel two, the game should have enemy cars (= maximum five enemy cars)</p>

<b>When an enemy car hits your car, the speed should be zero and background should not move.</b>
<p>When your car reaches at the end of map again, your game should finish.</p>
